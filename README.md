# Review of containment of covid19 across the world: summary of measures and lessons learned

Hi Nick,
I got started with this paper we were discussing today over email. I have invited you to this collaborative space where we can write the paper jointly. All you have to do is click anywhere here and write. You can upload images, and for citations, just write the author-year within a pair of square brackets like [@draper2020] and type the formatted references below where it says 'References' (see the example below). 

Now, the million dollar question is what are we going to write on the comparative performances of the different countries and systems? Anyway, let's get started with some ideas. 
Just so that we can have a project going, I have created this repository here:
https://osf.io/zh4vn/

I have added you as a contributor to the project and have sent you an email. When you receive the email, if you can kindly accept the email, that'd be great. You will see a copy of this paper reflected there as well, and you can directly edit the paper there. Just make sure not to edit the paper in Word (that is, do not download and edit it there, you can just edit it here and do not worry about version changes, the software takes care of everything).

## Abstract

We'd like to compare and contrast the performances in containment of the covid-19 epidemic across the world and the key lessons. Following the first 4 months of the pandemic, two distinct patterns have emerged worldwide: countries where the incidence rates have peaked and then dropped, and others where the incidence rates and the death rates from the pandemic continues unabated. In this paper, we review the containment strategies of the different countries and summarise the end results with respect to the different streategies. 
We obtained data from the JHU CSSE portal and analysed the data to explore the results graphically, and compared the different patterns by studying the patterns of the dates of containment measures including lockdowns.
While countries such as New Zealand and South Korea that had imposed lockdowns early and conducted extensive testing, and contact tracing seem to have reduced new spread of infections considerably, other countries that started containment measures later in the cycle of the epidemic have continued to register high incidence rates.
