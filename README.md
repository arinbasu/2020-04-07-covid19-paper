# Review of containment of covid19 across the world

Hi Nick,
I got started with this paper we were discussing today over email to write. I have invited you to this collaborative space where we can write the paper jointly. All you have to do is click anywhere here and write. There is not much conventions to write here. You can upload images, and for citations, just write the author-year within a pair of square brackets like [@draper2020] and type the formatted references below where it says 'References' (see the example below). 

Now, the million dollar question is what are we going to write on the comparative performances of the different countries and systems? Anyway, let's get started with some ideas. 
Just so that we can have a project going, I have created this repository here:
https://osf.io/zh4vn/

I have added you as a contributor to the project and have sent you an email. When you receive the email, if you can kindly accept the email, that'd be great. You will see a copy of this paper reflected there as well, and you can directly edit the paper there. Just make sure not to edit the paper in Word (that is, do not download and edit it there, you can just edit it here and do not worry about version changes, the software takes care of everything). Click on the buttons above to insert tables and comments, etc.
